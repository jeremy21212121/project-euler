// Project Euler question 3 - Largest prime factor of 600851475143.
// I was going for slightly more elegant than brute force. The longest loop is âˆš600851475143 / 2 = 387573 iterations. I'm pretty happy with that, given my (low) level of math.
//
// If the number was even, I'd have to divide by two until it wasn't anymore, which would add a couple of lines.
