# My project euler solutions
(Project Euler)[https://projecteuler.net/archives] is a set of math-related programming challenges that can be completed in your language of choice.

## That's nice... why?

To show off my chops... just kidding. I started this simply to become a better programmer and because I enjoy puzzles.

For some of the challenges, I did two versions: One is commented and clear with named functions, the other is as short as possible.

I take these seriously and do not cheat, so the code in them is my own.
