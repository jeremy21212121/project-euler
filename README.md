# My project euler solutions in JS

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) is a set of math-related programming challenges that can be completed in your language of choice.

I started this simply to become a better programmer and because I enjoy puzzles.

For some of the challenges, I did two versions: One is commented and clear with named functions, the other is as short as possible.

These solutions aren't supposed to be shared outside of the forum, but they are already all over the internet so I don't see the harm. If you are working through the problems, no peaking!
